Webapp for writing down assignments for the whole class.

This is the future successor of the [Klassenspiegel](https://github.com/Lezurex/Klassenspiegel) and a rewrite of the not-finished [Openclass](https://github.com/Lezurex/openclass-legacy).

This Node.js webapp provides an easy and simple way to write down assignments and tasks for the whole class, so nobody has to ask for the homework in a WhatsApp group chat ever again!

**This project is currently still under development!**
